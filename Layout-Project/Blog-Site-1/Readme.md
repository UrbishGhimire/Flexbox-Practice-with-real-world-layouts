This is a typical old blog site layout created just using flexbox.

I will have 2 version of this code : 
            1. A clean concise code
            2. Beginners way (messy code that I typically do)

    1. This one is clean and concise. I have used view port height and width (vh/vw) to make scale these element easily and precisely. This is the best way to size any element and also make it responsive which I discovered recently.
